Note:- In backend we have to took very professional approach to develope

Backend Development have major 2 components.

|
|--A programming language (java, js, php, python, golang, c++, etc) on a framework.
|--A database (Mongo, MySQL, Postgres, sqlite) on ORM ODM.


Browser<------>| |<-----> Backend<-------
               | |                      |
               |A|                      -----> DataBase    Another continent
               |P|                      -------^
               |I|                      |
Mobile<------->| |<------>backend<-------              

-A javascript based backend we deal with mostly three things 
-1. Data         
-2. File(vides, images, pdfs, etc)           
-3. Third Party(APIs)


-A JS Runtime: Nodejs/Demo/Bun
-Files which are generally found on backend code
-1. libraries:- Package.json   
-2. common files:- .env
-3. some Other files (Readme, git, lint, prettier, etc)

-for js we have to learn two libraries
|
|---express(for routing server)
|---Mongoose(for database)

there are many things but these are major one for js.

Directory Structure

----> src

-->index is the entry point of our application

index(DB connect)                                          App(config, cookie, urlendcode)                                     constants(enums, DB-name)

-DB(folder:contain db code,db call)                                
-Models(folder:contains schema/model of DB)
-controllers(folder:methods or functions)
-Routes(folder: define & handle routes)
-Middle wares
-utils(folder:contains reusable code snippets)
-more(depends)
